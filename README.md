Project Overview
This project involves analyzing student feedback from college events to determine satisfaction trends. Using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, raw survey data was transformed into actionable insights to help organizers improve future academic events.

Tools & Technologies
Python (Google Colab): Primary programming environment.
Pandas: For data cleaning and feature engineering.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
Sentiment Analysis: Logic-based categorization of student "mood" and satisfaction.

Insights & Visualizations
Sentiment Distribution: A pie chart showing the percentage of Positive, Neutral, and Negative feedback.
Category Performance: Bar charts showing average ratings for teaching quality, course structure, and support.
Correlation Matrix: A heatmap highlighting the strong relationship between "Doubts Solving" and "Course Recommendation."

Repository Contents
